# TreeleafAssignment

Task 1 of bank loan prediction is in the folder 'Bank Loan'
Tast 2a and 2b of rectable numbering and alignment are in the folder 'Rectangle openCV'

The allocated 2 days for the completion of the assignment was not enough. I could have made the EDA for task 1 a lot better. 

Also, maybe because the image provided for task 2a is not proper, I couldn't calculate the lenght of the inside-line of the rectangles properly and this, numbering is wrong.

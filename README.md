# TreeleafAssignment

Task 1 of bank loan prediction is in the folder 'Bank Loan'. the trained model and 'Summary and Analysis' in PDF format is also present here
Task 2a and 2b of rectangle numbering and alignment are in the folder 'Rectangle openCV'

The allocated 2 days for the completion of the assignment was not enough. I could have made the EDA for task 1 a lot better. 

Also, maybe because the image provided for task 2a wass not proper, I couldn't calculate the length of the inside-line of the rectangles properly, so the numbering is wrong.
